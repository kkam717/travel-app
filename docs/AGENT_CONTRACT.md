# Agent Contract (Clawdbot)

- Always branch from `develop`.
- Never push directly to `develop` or `main`.
- Always open a PR targeting `develop`.
- Keep diffs small and readable.
- Run: `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` before opening/updating the PR.
- Do not add new dependencies without asking.
- Never touch production secrets or deployment settings.
